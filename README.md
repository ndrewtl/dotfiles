# Dotfiles

Andrew Lee's dotfile configuration, for tools such as
  - `bash`
  - `zsh`
  - [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
  - `nvim`/`vim`
  - [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
  - [`sway`](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)
  - `xmonad`

To run these config files, simply clone this repository into `$HOME/.config`,
and most things should work out-of-the box.
